                        From the rugged coastline to glaciated peaks, the different hiking trails and places to visit in Oregon attract millions of tourists each year. 
                        Attractions like Eagle Creek and the McKenzie River are well reputed throughout the country, and much like the other best hiking trails in Oregon, each scenic location provides a range of activity, from family hikes to more challenging day-long or overnight adventures.
                        Hiking through history is possible on the traverse of the coastal Tillamook Head, and cultural attractions surround all thirty miles of the Wildwood Trail in Portland.
