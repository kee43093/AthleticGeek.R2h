                            <p>After Seth Tibbott founded Tofurky in 1980, he lived in a treehouse for seven years to save money. 
                                Today the company has its headquarters directly behind Solstice Wood Fire Café & Bar on the Columbia River. 
                                The restaurant tops its vegan pizza with Tofurky’s Italian sausage and dairy-free cheese. Wash it down with 
                                a local microbrew while taking in the Hood River’s waterfront.

                            <p>Marionberries were bred at Oregon State University by crossing two types of blackberries. Because they don’t ship well,
                               most fresh marionberries are used in-state 
                               to make muffins, jam, ice cream and the beloved fresh pie. The Willamette Valley Pie Company in Salem,
                               which processes an average of 12 million pounds of berries per year, makes three kinds of marionberry pie
                               and lets you pick your own marionberries in the summer.</p>
