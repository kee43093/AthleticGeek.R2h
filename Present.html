                        It's hard to pick any one state in the US to be the most beautiful.
                         In fact, almost every state is stunning with a wide range of beautiful natural attractions and well-designed man-made attractions.
                         A state in question is Oregon. Oregon is a beautiful state with stunning natural and man-made architectural wonders.
                         However, most tourists tend to bypass it for the larger more touristy states in the US.
                         If you are planning a trip anywhere this year, take a few minutes to consider these top 10 places to visit in Oregon.

                        and that makes for a lot of exciting adventures.Now is the time to start your very own Oregon bucket list,
                        filled with all the places and activities that make this state extraordinary. You might put riding a dune buggy at the top of your list, 
                        or maybe it’s at a close second to rafting a Wild and Scenic River.
                        We’ve got Oregon Scenic Bikeways, hundreds of waterfall trails and fun for every season.
                        How you rank the adventures is entirely up to you.
